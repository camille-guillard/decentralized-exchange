## Project introduction

Base Set is the name given to the first main expansion of the Pokémon Trading Card Game. In Japan, it was released as Expansion Pack, the first expansion in the Pokémon Card Game. It is based on Pokémon Red, Blue, and Green, featuring Generation I Pokémon. The English expansion was released on January 9, 1999, while the Japanese expansion was released on October 20, 1996. Although not part of the TCG, Bandai Pokémon Cards Part 1 Green & Part 2 Red (September 1996) is regarded as pre-dating the Japanese Base set, and therefore is the oldest known Pokémon Card release.<br/>
